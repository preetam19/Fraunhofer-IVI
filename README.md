# Fraunhofer-IVI

This is a repository created to complete the tasks given by Fraunhofer IVI. The data given is in the file temperature.csv where the data contains of the temperatures collected from the years 2015 to 2020. 

My tasks were:

Task 1: Convert the time steps of the temperature data to 15-minutes-intervals, using interpolation.

Task 2: Find the hottest and coldest temperature values for every year and their time of occurrence.
        Store this information in a human-readable file (csv or other text file or graphic).
      
Task 3: Plot the temperatures for the hottest days and coldest days of each provided year onto the same axis, over
time of day.

Task 4: Find the hottest and coldest temperature values for every month of the same year, in every year and plot them accordingly.
